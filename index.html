    <h2>About Universal Basic Income</h2>
    <p>Universal Basic Income <strong>(UBI)</strong>
      is the idea that every citizen should receive a minimum amount of income from the government 
      without means testing or the requirement of work.<br></br>Although the idea has recently gained momentum as a possible solution to the challenges posed
  by the coronavirus, the idea itself has existed in one form or another for longer than most people might think.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
  <h3>First recorded mentions</h3>
  <p>With the advent of the Renaissance the idea that the church and charitable individuals exclusively held responsibility for the welfare of the poor
    began to lose ground to the idea of help being provided by some kind of public assistance. <br> Thomas More's <em>Utopia</em> (1516) proposed 
    it as an idea to reduce thievery.<br></br>A decade later Valencian born Juan Luis Vives set out the idea in greater detail (although advocating work being given to the recipients),an adaptation of which was later put 
into place in the Flemish community of Ypres.</p>

  <h3>Development</h3>
<p>Over the next few centuries, the idea resurfaced in different forms. In 1797 the American revolutionary, Thomas Paine, championed 
a "national fund" that would award every American fifteen pounds sterling when they turned 21, and ten pounds per year after the age of 50.
  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. also announced his support for the idea in 1967.<br></br>
President Richard Nixon's 1969 proposal of the "Family Assistance Plan." The legislation promised to give an additional $10,400 (in 2016 dollars) each year to families who had kids, depending on income. 
While the FAP easily made it through the House of Representatives, it ultimately died in the Senate.</p>

<h3>First Modern Implementation</h3> 
<p>The "Mincome Program" took place in Manitoba, Canada. Between 1974 and 1979,<br></br>
residents in the city of Winnipeg and smaller nearby town of Dauphin received additional monthly income, again based on their income levels.
It wasn't until University of Manitoba economist Evelyn Forget discovered the Mincome files 20 years later that anyone realized what a success the program had been.
Forget's research showed hospitalization rates fell by 8.5%, high school completion rates went up, and new mothers could afford to work less.
And in general, few people stopped working â€” one of the key fears that's often cited about basic income.
