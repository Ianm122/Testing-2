    <h2>About Universal Basic Income</h2>
    <p>Universal Basic Income <strong>(UBI)</strong>
      is the idea that every citizen should recieve a minimum amount of income from the government 
      without means testing or the requirement of work.<br></br>Although recently the idea has gained momentum as a possible solution to the challenges posed
  by the coronavirus, the idea itself has existed in one form or another for longer than most people might think.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
  <h3>First recorded mentions</h3>
  <p>With the advent of the Renaissance the idea that the church and charitable individuals exclusively held responsibility for the welfare of the poor
    began to lose ground to the idea of help being provided by some kind of public assistance. Some of the so-called Humanists started
    playing around with the idea of some kind of minimum income.Thomas More's <em>Utopia</em>, first published in 1516, proposed 
    it as an idea to reduce thievery.<br></br>A decade later Valencian born Juan Luis Vives set out the idea in greater detail (although advocating work being given to the recipients),on adaptation of which was later put 
into place in the Flemish community of Ypres.</p>
  <h3>Development</h3>
<p>Over the next few centuries, the idea resurfaced in different forms. In 1797 the American revolutionary, Thomas Paine, championed 
a "national fund" that would award every American fifteen pounds sterling when they turned 21, and ten pounds per year after the age of 50.
  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. also announced his suport for the idea in 1967.</p>
